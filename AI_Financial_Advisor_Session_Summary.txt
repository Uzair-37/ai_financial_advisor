   ‚úÖ Fixed technical indicators calculation error
   ‚úÖ Problem: DataFrame dimension mismatch in moving averages
   ‚úÖ Solution: Calculate indicators for each column separately
   ‚úÖ Fixed both main and deploy versions

3. CREATED COMPREHENSIVE NLP SYSTEM
   ‚úÖ Built FinancialExplainer - translates 60+ financial terms
   ‚úÖ Built NewsAnalyzer - analyzes financial news sentiment
   ‚úÖ Built MarketInterpreter - explains economic indicators
   ‚úÖ All modules provide human-friendly explanations

===============================================================================
üîß TECHNICAL FIXES IMPLEMENTED
===============================================================================

BUG FIX - Finance Page Technical Indicators:
PROBLEM: 
- df.rolling(window=ma_window).mean() returned multi-column DataFrame
- Trying to assign to single column df[f'MA_{ma_window}'] caused ValueError

SOLUTION:
- Calculate moving averages for each column separately
- Loop through original_columns and create individual MA columns
- Fixed both RSI and moving average calculations

BEFORE (BROKEN):
```python
df[f'MA_{ma_window}'] = df.rolling(window=ma_window).mean()
```

AFTER (FIXED):
```python
for col in original_columns:
    ma_col_name = f'MA_{ma_window}_{col}'
    df[ma_col_name] = df[col].rolling(window=ma_window).mean()
```

CLIMATE REMOVAL:
- Removed climate_adapter.py completely
- Removed climate.py page
- Updated navigation from 5 tabs to 4 tabs
- Cleaned up all imports and references
- Updated session state management
- Removed climate data storage functions
